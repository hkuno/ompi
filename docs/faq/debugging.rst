Parallel debugging

How do I debug Open MPI processes in parallel?
----------------------------------------------

This is a difficult question.  Debugging in serial can be
tricky: errors, uninitialized variables, stack smashing, etc.
Debugging in parallel adds multiple different dimensions to this
problem: a greater propensity for race conditions, asynchronous
events, and the general difficulty of trying to understand N processes
simultaneously executing |mdash| the problem becomes quite formidable.

This FAQ section does not provide any definite solutions to
debugging in parallel.  At best, it shows some general techniques and
a few specific examples that may be helpful to your situation.

But there are various controls within Open MPI that can help with
debugging.  These are probably the most valuable entries in this FAQ
section.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

What tools are available for debugging in parallel?
---------------------------------------------------

There are two main categories of tools that can aid in
parallel debugging:

* *Debuggers:* Both serial and parallel debuggers are useful.  Serial
  debuggers are what most programmers are used to (e.g., gdb), while
  parallel debuggers can attach to all the individual processes in an
  MPI job simultaneously, treating the MPI application as a single
  entity.  This can be an extremely powerful abstraction, allowing the
  user to control every aspect of the MPI job, manually replicate race
  conditions, etc.

* *Profilers:* Tools that analyze your usage of MPI and display
  statistics and meta information about your application's run.  Some
  tools present the information \"live\" (as it occurs), while others
  collect the information and display it in a post mortem analysis.

Both freeware and commercial solutions are available for each kind of
tool.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

What controls does Open MPI have that aid in debugging?
-------------------------------------------------------

Open MPI has a series of MCA parameters for the MPI layer
itself that are designed to help with debugging.  These parameters can
be <a href=\"?category=tuning#setting-mca-params\">can be set in the
usual ways</a>.  MPI-level MCA parameters can be displayed by invoking
the following command:

.. code-block:: sh
   :linenos:

   # Use "--level 9" to see all the MCA parameters
   # (the default is "--level 1"):
   shell$ ompi_info --param mpi all --level 9

Here is a summary of the debugging parameters for the MPI layer:

* ``mpi_param_check``: If set to true (any positive value), and when
  Open MPI is compiled with parameter checking enabled (the default),
  the parameters to each MPI function can be passed through a series
  of correctness checks.  Problems such as passing illegal values
  (e.g., NULL or ``MPI_DATATYPE_NULL`` or other "bad" values) will be
  discovered at run time and an MPI exception will be invoked (the
  default of which is to print a short message and abort the entire
  MPI job).  If set to false, these checks are disabled, slightly
  increasing performance.

* ``mpi_show_handle_leaks``: If set to true (any positive value),
  Open MPI will display lists of any MPI handles that were not freed before
  ``MPI_FINALIZE`` (e.g., communicators, datatypes, requests, etc.)

* ``mpi_no_free_handles``: If set to true (any positive value), do not
  actually free MPI objects when their corresponding MPI "free"
  function is invoked (e.g., do not free communicators when
  ``MPI_COMM_FREE`` is invoked).  This can be helpful in tracking down
  applications that accidentally continue to use MPI handles after
  they have been freed.

* ``mpi_show_mca_params``: If set to true (any positive value), show a
  list of all MCA parameters and their values during ``MPI_INIT``.
  This can be quite helpful for reproducibility of MPI applications.

* ``mpi_show_mca_params_file``: If set to a non-empty value, and if
  the value of ``mpi_show_mca_params`` is true, then output the list
  of MCA parameters to the filename value.  If this parameter is an
  empty value, the list is sent to ``stderr``.

* ``mpi_keep_peer_hostnames``: If set to a true value (any positive
  value), send the list of all hostnames involved in the MPI job to
  every process in the job.  This can help the specificity of error
  messages that Open MPI emits if a problem occurs (i.e., Open MPI can
  display the name of the peer host that it was trying to communicate
  with), but it can somewhat slow down the startup of large-scale MPI
  jobs.

* ``mpi_abort_delay``: If nonzero, print out an identifying message
  when ``MPI_ABORT`` is invoked showing the hostname and PID of the
  process that invoked ``MPI_ABORT``, and then delay that many seconds
  before exiting.  A negative value means to delay indefinitely.  This
  allows a user to manually come in and attach a debugger when an
  error occurs.  Remember that the default MPI error handler |mdash|
  ``MPI_ERRORS_ABORT`` |mdash| invokes ``MPI_ABORT``, so this
  parameter can be useful to discover problems identified by
  ``mpi_param_check``.

* ``mpi_abort_print_stack``: If nonzero, print out a stack trace (on
  supported systems) when ``MPI_ABORT`` is invoked.

* ``mpi_ddt_<foo>_debug``, where ``<foo>`` can be one of ``pack``,
  ``unpack``, ``position``, or ``copy``: These are internal debugging
  features that are not intended for end users (but ``ompi_info`` will
  report that they exist).

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Do I need to build Open MPI with compiler/linker debugging flags (such as ``-g``) to be able to debug MPI applications?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No.

If you build Open MPI without compiler/linker debugging flags (such as
``-g``), you will not be able to step inside MPI functions
when you debug your MPI applications.  However, this is likely what
you want |mdash| the internals of Open MPI are quite complex and you
probably don't want to start poking around in there.

You'll need to compile your own applications with ``-g`` (or whatever
your compiler's equivalent is), but unless you have a need/desire to
be able to step into MPI functions to see the internals of Open MPI,
you do not need to build Open MPI with ``-g``.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Can I use serial debuggers (such as ``gdb``) to debug MPI applications?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes; the Open MPI developers do this all the time.

There are two common ways to use serial debuggers.

Attach to individual MPI processes after they are running
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For example, launch your MPI application as normal with ``mpirun``.
Then login to the node(s) where your application is running and use
the ``--pid`` option to ``gdb`` to attach to your application.

An inelegant-but-functional technique commonly used with this method
is to insert the following code in your application where you want to
attach:

.. code-block:: c
   :linenos:

   {
       volatile int i = 0;
       char hostname[256];
       gethostname(hostname, sizeof(hostname));
       printf("PID %d on %s ready for attach\n", getpid(), hostname);
       fflush(stdout);
       while (0 == i)
           sleep(5);
   }

This code will output a line to stdout outputting the name of the host
where the process is running and the PID to attach to.  It will then
spin on the ``sleep()`` function forever waiting for you to attach
with a debugger.  Using ``sleep()`` as the inside of the loop means
that the processor won't be pegged at 100% while waiting for you to
attach.

Once you attach with a debugger, go up the function stack until you
are in this block of code (you'll likely attach during the
``sleep()``) then set the variable ``i`` to a nonzero value.  With
GDB, the syntax is:

.. code-block:: sh
   :linenos:

   (gdb) set var i = 7

Then set a breakpoint after your block of code and continue execution
until the breakpoint is hit.  Now you have control of your live MPI
application and use of the full functionality of the debugger.

You  can even  add  conditionals to  only allow  this  "pause" in  the
application for specific MPI  processes (e.g., ``MPI_COMM_WORLD`` rank
0, or whatever process is misbehaving).

Use ``mpirun`` to launch separate instances of serial debuggers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This technique launches a separate window for each MPI process in
``MPI_COMM_WORLD``, each one running a serial debugger (such as
``gdb``) that will launch and run your MPI application.  Having a
separate window for each MPI process can be quite handy for low
process-count MPI jobs, but requires a bit of setup and configuration
that is outside of Open MPI to work properly.  A naive approach would
be to assume that the following would immediately work:

.. code-block:: sh
   :linenos:

    shell$ mpirun -np 4 xterm -e gdb my_mpi_application

If running on a personal computer, this will probably work.  You can
also use `tmpi <https://github.com/Azrael3000/tmpi>`_ to launch the
debuggers in separate ``tmux`` panes instead of separate ``xterm``
windows, which has the advantage of synchronizing keyboard input
between all debugger instances.

Unfortunately, the ``tmpi`` or ``xterm`` approaches likely *won't*
work on an computing cluster. Several factors must be considered:

#.  What launcher is Open MPI using?  In an ``ssh``-based environment,
    Open MPI will default to using ``ssh`` when it is available,
    falling back to ``rsh`` when ``ssh`` cannot be found in the
    ``$PATH``.  But note that Open MPI closes the ``ssh`` (or ``rsh``)
    sessions when the MPI job starts for scalability reasons.  This
    means that the built-in SSH X forwarding tunnels will be shut down
    before the ``xterms`` can be launched.  Although it is possible to
    force Open MPI to keep its SSH connections active (to keep the X
    tunneling available), we recommend using non-SSH-tunneled X
    connections, if possible (see below).

#. In non-``ssh`` environments (such as when using resource managers),
   the environment of the process invoking ``mpirun`` may be copied to
   all nodes.  In this case, the ``DISPLAY`` environment variable may
   not be suitable.

#. Some operating systems default to disabling the X11 server from
   listening for remote/network traffic.  For example, see `this post
   on the Open MPI user's mailing list
   <https://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2008/02/4995.php>`_
   describing how to enable network access to the X11 server on Fedora
   Linux.

#. There may be intermediate firewalls or other network blocks that
   prevent X traffic from flowing between the hosts where the MPI
   processes (and ``xterm``) are running and the host connected to
   the output display.

The easiest way to get remote X applications (such as ``xterm``) to
display on your local screen is to forego the security of SSH-tunneled
X forwarding.  In a closed environment such as an HPC cluster, this
may be an acceptable practice (indeed, you may not even have the
option of using SSH X forwarding if SSH logins to cluster nodes are
disabled), but check with your security administrator to be sure.

If using non-encrypted X11 forwarding is permissible, we recommend the
following:

#. For each non-local host where you will be running an MPI process,
   add it to your X server's permission list with the ``xhost``
   command.  For example:

   .. code-block:: sh
      :linenos:

      shell$ cat my_hostfile
      inky
      blinky
      stinky
      clyde
      shell$ for host in `cat my_hostfile` ; do xhost +host ; done

#. Use the ``-x`` option to ``mpirun`` to export an appropriate
   DISPLAY variable so that the launched X applications know where to
   send their output.  An appropriate value is *usually* (but not
   always) the hostname containing the display where you want the
   output and the ``:0`` (or ``:0.0``) suffix.  For example:

   .. code-block:: sh
      :linenos:

      shell$ hostname
      arcade.example.come
      shell$ mpirun -np 4 --hostfile my_hostfile \
          -x DISPLAY=arcade.example.com:0 xterm -e gdb my_mpi_application

   .. warning:: X traffic is fairly "heavy" |mdash| if you are
                operating over a slow network connection, it may take
                some time before the ``xterm`` windows appear on your
                screen.

#. If your ``xterm`` supports it, the ``-hold`` option may be useful.
   ``-hold`` tells ``xterm`` to stay open even when the application
   has completed.  This means that if something goes wrong (e.g.,
   ``gdb`` fails to execute, or unexpectedly dies, or ...), the
   ``xterm`` window will stay open, allowing you to see what happened,
   instead of closing immediately and losing whatever error message
   may have been output.

#. When you have finished, you may wish to disable X11 network
   permissions from the hosts that you were using.  Use ``xhost``
   again to disable these permissions:

   .. code-block:: sh
      :linenos:

      shell$ for host in `cat my_hostfile` ; do xhost -host ; done

.. note:: ``mpirun`` will not complete until all the ``xterm``
          instances are complete.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

My process dies without any output.  Why?
-----------------------------------------

There many be many reasons for this; the Open MPI Team strongly
encourages the use of tools (such as debuggers) whenever possible.

One of the reasons, however, may come from inside Open MPI itself.  If
your application fails due to memory corruption, Open MPI may
subsequently fail to output an error message before dying.
Specifically, starting with v1.3, Open MPI attempts to aggregate error
messages from multiple processes in an attempt to show unique error
messages only once (vs. one for each MPI process |mdash| which can be
unwieldy, especially when running large MPI jobs).

However, this aggregation process requires allocating memory in the
MPI process when it displays the error message.  If the process's
memory is already corrupted, Open MPI's attempt to allocate memory may
fail and the process will simply die, possibly silently.  When Open
MPI does not attempt to aggregate error messages, most of its setup
work is done during MPI_INIT and no memory is allocated during the
"print the error" routine.  It therefore almost always successfully
outputs error messages in real time |mdash| but at the expense that you'll
potentially see the same error message for *each* MPI process that
encountered the error.

Hence, the error message aggregation is _usually_ a good thing, but
sometimes it can mask a real error.  You can disable Open MPI's error
message aggregation with the ``orte_base_help_aggregate`` MCA
parameter.  For example:

.. code-block:: sh
   :linenos:

   shell$ mpirun --mca orte_base_help_aggregate 0 ...

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

What is Memchecker?
-------------------

The Memchecker  allows MPI semantic
checking for your application (as well as internals of Open MPI), with
the help of memory checking tools such as the Memcheck of `the
Valgrind suite <https://www.valgrind.org/>`_.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

What kind of errors can Memchecker find?
----------------------------------------

Memchecker is implemented on the basis of the Memcheck tool from
Valgrind, so it takes all the advantages from it. Firstly, it checks
all reads and writes of memory, and intercepts calls to
malloc/new/free/delete. Most importantly, Memchecker is able to detect
the user buffer errors in both Non-blocking and One-sided
communications, e.g. reading or writing to buffers of active
non-blocking Recv-operations and writing to buffers of active
non-blocking Send-operations.

Here are some example codes that Memchecker can detect:

Accessing buffer under control of non-blocking communication:

.. code-block:: c
   :linenos:

   int buf;
   MPI_Irecv(&buf, 1, MPI_INT, 1, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD, &req);
   // The following line will produce a memchecker warning
   buf = 4711;
   MPI_Wait (&req, &status);

Wrong input parameters, e.g., wrong-sized send buffers:

.. code-block:: c
   :linenos:

   char *send_buffer;
   send_buffer = malloc(5);
   memset(send_buffer, 0, 5);
   // The following line will produce a memchecker warning
   MPI_Send(send_buffer, 10, MPI_CHAR, 1, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);

Accessing a window in a one-sided communication:

.. code-block:: c
   :linenos:

   MPI_Get(A, 10, MPI_INT, 1, 0, 1, MPI_INT, win);
   A[0] = 4711;
   MPI_Win_fence(0, win);

Uninitialized input buffers:

.. code-block:: c
   :linenos:

   char *buffer;
   buffer = malloc(10);
   // The following line will produce a memchecker warning
   MPI_Send(buffer, 10, MPI_INT, 1, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);

Usage of the uninitialized ``MPI_Status`` field in ``MPI_ERROR``
structure: (the MPI-1 standard defines the ``MPI ERROR`` field to be
undefined for single-completion calls such as ``MPI_WAIT`` or
``MPI_TEST``, see MPI-1 p. 22):

.. code-block:: c
   :linenos:

   MPI_Wait(&request, &status);
   // The following line will produce a memchecker warning
   if (status.MPI_ERROR != MPI_SUCCESS)
       return ERROR;

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

How do I build Open MPI with Memchecker support?
------------------------------------------------

To use Memchecker, you need Valgrind 3.2.0 or later, and have an Open
MPI that was configured with the ``--enable-memchecker`` and
``--enable-debug`` flags.

.. note:: The Memchecker functionality is off by default, because it
          incurs a performance penalty.

When ``--enable-memchecker`` is specified, ``configure`` will check
for a recent-enable Valgrind distribution.  If found, Open MPI will
build Memchecker support.

For example:

.. code-block:: sh
   :linenos:

   shell$ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/openmpi --enable-debug \
       --enable-memchecker --with-valgrind=/path/to/valgrind

You can check that Open MPI was built with Memchecker support by using
the ``ompi_info`` application:

.. code-block:: sh
   :linenos:

   # The exact version numbers shown may be different for your Open
   # MPI installation
   shell$ ompi_info | grep memchecker
   MCA memchecker: valgrind (MCA v1.0, API v1.0, Component v1.3)

If you do not see the "MCA memchecker: valgrind" line, ou probably
didn't configure and install Open MPI correctly.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

How to run my MPI application with Memchecker?
----------------------------------------------

First of all, you have to make sure that Valgrind 3.2.0 or later is
installed, and Open MPI is compiled with Memchecker support
enabled. Then simply run your application with Valgrind, e.g.:

.. code-block:: sh
   :linenos:

   shell$ mpirun -np 2 valgrind ./my_app

Or if you enabled Memchecker, but you don't want to check the
application at this time, then just run your application as
usual. E.g.:

.. code-block:: sh
   :linenos:

   shell$ mpirun -np 2 ./my_app

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Does Memchecker cause performance degradation to my application?
----------------------------------------------------------------

The configure option ``--enable-memchecker`` (together with
``--enable-debug``) *does* cause performance degradation, even if not
running under Valgrind.  The following explains the mechanism and may
help in making the decision whether to provide a cluster-wide
installation with ``--enable-memchecker``.

There are two cases:

#. If run without Valgrind, the Valgrind ClientRequests (assembler
   instructions added to the normal execution path for checking) do
   not affect overall MPI performance. Valgrind ClientRequests are
   explained in detail `in Valgrind's documentation
   <https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/manual-core-adv.html>`_.
   In the case of x86-64, ClientRequests boil down to the following
   four rotate-left (ROL) and one xchange (XCHG) assembler instructions
   from ``valgrind.h``:

   .. code-block:: c
      :linenos:

      #define __SPECIAL_INSTRUCTION_PREAMBLE                      \
                     "rolq \$3,  %%rdi; rolq \$13, %%rdi\\n\\t"   \
                     "rolq \$61, %%rdi; rolq \$51, %%rdi\\n\\t"

   and

   .. We do not make the code block below as "c" because the Sphinx C
      syntax highlighter fails to parse it as C and emits a warning.
      So we might as well just leave it as a plan verbatim block
      (i.e., not syntax hilighted).

   .. code-block::
      :linenos:

      __asm__ volatile(__SPECIAL_INSTRUCTION_PREAMBLE               \
                     /* %RDX = client_request ( %RAX ) */           \
                     "xchgq %%rbx,%%rbx"                            \
                     : "=d" (_zzq_result)                           \
                     : "a" (& _zzq_args``0``), "0" (_zzq_default)   \
                     : "cc", "memory"                               \
                    );

   for every single ClientRequest.  In the case of not running
   Valgrind, these ClientRequest instructions do not change the
   arithmetic outcome (rotating a 64-bit register left by 128-Bits,
   exchanging a register with itself), except for the carry flag.

   The first request is checking whether we're running under Valgrind.
   In case we're not running under Valgrind subsequent checks (aka ClientRequests)
   are not done.

#. If the application is run under Valgrind, performance is naturally reduced due
   to the Valgrind JIT and the checking tool employed.
   For costs and overheads of Valgrind's Memcheck tool on the SPEC 2000 Benchmark,

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Is Open MPI "Valgrind-clean" or how can I identify real errors?
---------------------------------------------------------------

This issue has been raised many times on the mailing list, e.g., `such
as here
<https://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2007/05/3192.php>`_
`and here
<https://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2009/06/9565.php>`_.

There are many situations where Open MPI purposefully does not initialize and
subsequently communicates memory, e.g., by calling ``writev(2)``.
Furthermore, several cases are known where memory is not properly freed upon
``MPI_FINALIZE``.

This certainly does not help distinguishing real errors from false positives.
Valgrind provides functionality to suppress errors and warnings from certain
function contexts.

In an attempt to ease debugging using Valgrind, Open MPI provides a
so-called Valgrind-suppression file, that can be passed on the command
line:

.. code-block:: sh
   :linenos:

   shell$ mpirun -np 2 valgrind --suppressions=$PREFIX/share/openmpi/openmpi-valgrind.supp

More information on suppression-files and how to generate them can be
found in `Valgrind's documentation
<https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/manual-core.html#manual-core.suppress>`_.
