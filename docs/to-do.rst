Things that have changed in v5.0
================================

Need to update these docs to reflect:

* By default, components are now slurped up to be part of their
  project libraries, not DSOs.

* 32 bit support only built when we have C11 compiler

* What specifically does ``--disable-io-romio`` do?

* Do we still have AMCA files?

* Do we still have ``--tune`` files?
